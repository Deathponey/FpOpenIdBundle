FpOpenIdBundle
==============

The FpOpenIdBundle adds support of [openid authentication](http://openid.net/) to symfony's security. It uses [LightOpenId](http://gitorious.org/lightopenid) as a relying party(client).

Features include:

- Fully integrated to Symfony's Security
- Unit tested

**Note:** Previous versions of the bundle [1.0](https://github.com/formapro/FpOpenIdBundle/tree/1.0) for Symfony 2.0.x and [1.1](https://github.com/formapro/FpOpenIdBundle/tree/1.1) for Symfony 2.1.x
are not supported any more.

**Caution:** This bundle is developed in sync with [symfony's repository](https://github.com/symfony/symfony).
